# Introduction
This repository contains code and explaination for a group of pathfinding questions

A network is provided, containing bidirectional edges representing a road network. Each edge contains two properties which must be optimised for in each of the questions.
This readme is intentionally sparse as the problem is currently still being used by the University.

Run the individual question files to display the optimal path and corresponding metrics for each path.
